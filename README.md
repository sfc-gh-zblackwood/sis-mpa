# SiS MPA Hack

Multipage streamlit apps aren't supported today (2022-01-13) in SiS, so I pulled
some code from [st_pages](https://github.com/blackary/st_pages), and it worked!

1. Create an app with the code from main_page.py
2. Set up the page list at the bottom of the script
3. Upload all of the other pages to the stage of your app
4. Profit!
